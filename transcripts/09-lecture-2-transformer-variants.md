Cool. Hello everyone. Welcome to lecture two of CME295. So before we start, I wanted to give you a heads up about two logistical things. So the first one is uh with Shervin we reviewed the recording of lecture one and we couldn't help but notice that the audio was suboptimal.

So what we're doing for this lecture is to have another setup. But then one issue is my voice will not be you know propagated in the room. So I guess I have one question. Can any everyone hear me very well even from the back? Okay cool. Great. So that's point number one. Point number two is about the final

exam. So the final exam right now has a placeholder dates for Wednesday, I think December the 10th. But uh just a heads up that we're trying to see if there's a way to move that to earlier in the week. So we'll let you know when that's finalized, but for now uh this is still TBD, but we'll make sure to let you

know. Cool. So with that aside, let's go into today's topic. But before we do that, as always, what we will do is we'll just quickly recap what we saw in the previous episodes. So if you remember, lecture one was all about introducing the concept of self

attention. And if you remember what self attention is is that each token is attending to all other token in the sequence through this mechanism of attention. So you have these notations of queries, keys and values. So here the idea is that the query is going to ask which other tokens

are most similar to itself by comparing query and key and then once that's done uh basically we will be taking the associated value. So we saw that the self attention mechanism can be expressed in with this formula. So soft max of query * qranspose over square root of dk * v.

So I hope this formula is familiar for you. Um so just know that this formula is highly optimized. You know these are like big matrix multiplications that our hardware is uh very um you know capable of doing is very optimized in doing that. And all of that to say that we also

introduced the architecture of the transformer which you can see on the right. So uh here if you remember the transformer is composed of two main components. So the encoder on the left side and the decoder on the right side and uh the transformer was initially

introduced in the context of machine translation. So you can think of the left side as processing the input text in the source language say English and the right side is responsible for decoding the translation in a target language let's say in French

and this multi head attention layer is where the self attention mechanism happens and um I remember there was a lot of questions regarding you know um it's called multi-head attention layer so there are several heads what does that correspond to

so in the transformer paper which is the attention is unit paper you have this figure which actually represents each of these heads and you can think of each head as an opportunity for the model to learn one way of projecting the input into being a query, a key or a

value. So just being a bit more clear. So for instance for the query and the key, so this is like each heads. So the number of these little boxes is basically the number of heads. And to better visualize and understand what this means, um

I also wanted to show I guess what is being shown in the paper which is a way to interpret what each of these heads do. So we have this concept called attention map which basically um tries to represent the value of each of

these query.p product query. So in this example what we're interested in is to see which other token is being most similar to token its And so what we do is we take a look at the quantities the query that is representing it product all other keys

and we look at what other keys are leading to a high value of the product query times key. And when you do that basically what you see or what the paper sees is you have these two words. So application and law which are highlighted as being you know with a high attention weight. So

attention weight here being uh the dotproduct of the query eats and the key uh you know for each of these tokens. And I guess there is also a way to interpret those. And here you can see that the tokens that are being kind of highlighted are law and application which basically makes sense because the

token eats is referring to law. So basically the model needs to kind of learn how to associate these words with what happened before. And it is also referring to application which is also another way of kind of explaining why that is the case. And so here what the authors chose to do was to show these

values as a function of these different heads. So for instance on the left side these are the kind of intensity for heads for let's say the first heads and then the second heads shows that you know the intensity is very high for law. So basically long story short these heads

may learn I guess different ways of uh kind of figuring out what what words matters. Yeah. >> Great question. So the question is when we're doing all these computations, are they going through different uh different MLPS? The answer is that we're going to have different projection

matrices for each of them. And so um you can think of um so we had this like detailed example that actually kind of uh went through that where each head is going to have its own projection and in parallel you're going to have that computation that's going to happen.

So each head is going to have one result here that is then going to be concatenated and then projected once once again with the output matrix. So yeah, long story short, it's highly parallelized and uh it's basically just like

projections and like here you have like some matrix multiplication and softmax. Does that make sense? >> Cool. Any other questions on this? Cool. So, I guess this is just a way to illustrate the conversation we had for, you know, lecture one. I know there was

some questions about about um these uh attention heads, what they do. And I guess looking at the attention maps is one way of making sense of what they mean. Cool. With that, I highly recommend that you read the transformers paper. So, attention is all you need. So, it's a

very dense paper. It's just a few pages long. Uh, but I hope that what we you've seen in lecture one, you'll be able to digest the content in a way that will kind of make sense to you. Cool. So, with that, we're going to start the actual meat of what we're going to discuss today.

So surprisingly this transformer architecture which was introduced in 2017 is actually an architecture that has kind of um you know still stayed relevant along the years and there are few components that have slightly changed and we're going to see which

ones they are. So there are like some slight variations but overall today's models are we're going to see all more or less based on the initial transformer architecture. So we're going to try to divide the class in in in two parts. So the first one is what I'm going to cover which is

what are the parts of the transformer that are important and that had some variation. And in the second part, Shervin is going to talk about um I guess the nomenclature of today's models and how they relate to the original transformer. Cool.

Okay. So, let's start with the first important concept that's in this architecture and this is the position embedding. So if you remember here, we're letting tokens interact with all other tokens in a direct fashion. So they have direct links.

But contrary to things like RNNs where you have a sequential dependency where you process each token one at a time here you're basically losing this idea of a token being processed before another one. So you kind of lose this position information. So as a result of that we need to

somehow quantify positions at sorry tokens at each position and try to inject that information when the transformer is processing the the inputs. So how are we going to do that? So the original transformer paper authors,

they choose to have a dedicated embedding. And when I say dedicated, what that means is each position has one embedding. So position one has one embedding, position two has one embedding, etc., etc. And what they chose to do is

to add that embedding to the input token embedding. So for instance, if I say a cute teddy bear is reading uh which is position number one will be represented by the token representing the token A plus the embedding representing the first position.

Yeah, >> it's a great question. So the question is are the position embeddings learned or static? Both. Both as in the authors have tried both and we're going to see what the second one is. But I guess I guess here let's suppose that they are learned. So what

does that mean? So that means that basically you need to learn embeddings for each position. And um the problem with this approach is that you're very much dependent on what is in your training set. So for instance um like here if you have somehow a text that always has something

that is happening at position number two your learn embeddings will kind of have that bias kind of learned. So that's like one limitation of that. Second limitation is you can only learn positions up to the max number of position that is in your training set. So let's suppose you train your

transformer on sequences that are up to let's say I don't know 512 let's say you can only learn position embeddings up to that position right yeah so the question is I guess how do you parameterize that so I guess what you do is you have a kind of a placeholder of a position learnable

position embedding. Let's say between like position one and 512. And basically when you do your training, you're just letting these these weights be learned through the regular, you know, gradient descent, all these things. So yeah, so this is like the first

method. Uh but as I was mentioning, it has its limitations. um because you can only learn embeddings of positions up to the max position that is present in the training set. So for instance, if you have at inference time a position that is beyond the position that was uh in the training set, well

you have not learned that. So you need to find a way to kind of infer the value. So that's the second limitation. And uh but yeah, but on the pro side, I guess you're just letting your model learn and uh we've seen that the gradient descent does wonders when it comes to just, you know, learning from

the data. Um so yeah and for these reasons these methods was something that the authors said that was performing well along with a second method which is different which is around having an arbitrary formula for each dimension

corresponding to a position embedding. And we're going to see that now. So first method was you know you have one embedding per position and you just learn that. Second method is you have one embedding per position but you're not going to learn that. you're going to have

something that is predetermined that you're going to use and we're going to see that what the authors chose was a formulation using s and cosine. So it can feel kind of weird, you know, why did they choose this? But we're going to see why that makes sense.

So the idea here is for a given position let's say m have a vector of size d model. So d needs to match the dimension of your token embeddings because of course you're adding them. And what you're going to do is for every index you're going to compute the

corresponding value with respect to these formulas. So what are these formulas? So it's basically s of something time m and we're going to see what that something something means. And then the second one is cosine of something* m. So who remembers trigonometry formulas?

Cool. Everyone. So before we go into that, let's just simplify the notations. Let's just assume that this big quantity that you saw is actually something like omega. So let's suppose it's omega as a function of i * m and you note omega i as being this you

know quantity. So 10,000 to the^ of minus 2 i over d model. Let's suppose you you construct your embeddings to have this way. Then I guess I want us to think about why that would make sense. Because if you think about it,

what you want is to represent positions in a way that reflects the following facts. words that are close together are likely to be more relevant as opposed to words that are further together, right? So, if you have two words that are like just one position

apart versus 10 10,000 position apart, what you want is that the one that is one position apart is more similar than the other one. So, let's see if the formula makes sense. So let's suppose you have two position embeddings. So one at position m and the other one at position n.

And let's suppose you compute, you know, all the values from this predetermined um formula. Well, it turns out if you remember your trigonometry formulas, so cosine of a minus b is equal to cosine of a cosine of b plus sin a sin b. Right?

Well, turns out that if you express cosine of omega i factor of m minus n, this is something that you obtain. It's just like the identity that I mentioned. Well, it just turns out that this quantity is just one component that appears when

you do the dotproduct of these two position embeddings. Right? Because basically here when you do the dot product of position m and position n what you do is you take the first position you multiply them then you plus the second position you multiply them

etc etc and then you come here it's s of this time s of this plus cosine of this time cosine of this right which is just this quantity. So at the end of the day what you realize is that when you perform a dotproduct of these embeddings you end up with a sum of cosine

that are a function of the relative distance between m and n. Yeah. What do you mean by pair by the way? >> Exactly. Yeah. So basically, so the question is um Yeah. So the closer they are, the more similar they are. So that's the intuition that basically this

way are formulating uh the embeddings is trying to approximate or is trying to mimic. So with that you basically obtain a dot product that is just a function of m and n the relative distance between them actually. Um and just as a reminder so why do I care about the dot products?

It's because if you're remember in the embedding world when we try to quantify the similarity between two embeddings what we do is typically something that is involving the dotproduct of these two. So you typically have the cosine similarity but cosine similarity is just dotproduct

over the norm of each embedding. So which is basically a dot product right? So that's why we care about the dot product. And here we see great it's a function of the relative distance between the two. So in particular again if you remember your trigonometry class

cosine of zero is one and the higher this number the lower the value of cosine of this number. Right? Of course, it's uh periodic. So, what I'm saying is not necessarily true. Past 2 pi or sorry uh pi just goes the other way. But I guess

what I'm trying to say is for m equal to n you'll have basically a sum of cosine of zero and it is the value at which this quantity is maximum. So when m is equal to n this quantity is maximum which means basically if you're

looking at the position itself it's the most similar which basically matches our intuition and so now when you plot the values of the embeddings this is what you obtain. So here in this graph on the yaxis I'm basically representing all the embeddings for each of the let's say 50

positions and on the x-axis it's basically values along a given vector across several dimensions of a vector. So if you take let's say the first row, you're looking at the first or number zero position depending on how you index your vector and you're looking at all the

values of the position zero embedding. And so you see that uh for low dimensions this value kind of goes up and down very frequently. So it's more high frequency and when the dimension is high it basically takes a lot of time for the value to go up and down. So it's

basically more low frequency. So this relates to this omega I that I mentioned this omega I. So omega I is very high for low values of I which is the dimension and is very low for high values of I. So this basically just determines how

quickly your cosine and sign basically vary. Cool. So this is what the original authors have tried and basically what they said what they noted was that using this method leads to comparable results compared to the learned one.

But here we have a big advantage because it can extend to any sequence length not just the sequence length that you saw at training time. And this is one of the reasons why you know this may be something that is preferable. So yeah this is the intuition and this

is what the authors chose. Now fast forward to 2025 guess you may ask me are we still using that? And the answer is kind of. So we're still using this idea of we want far I guess tokens to be less similar than closer tokens. But we're not injecting the embedding

like they did. And we're going to see why. Because if you remember, what you care about is determining how similar tokens are in the self attention computation. And where does the self attention computation happen?

In the attention layer. But here what what did I say? I said let's compute these embeddings and let's add them here. But actually what we want is to reflect this similarity in the attention layer. Do you have a question? Yeah.

So in this first method, yes. So the question is is it added to the input feature? Yes. Yes, just add. Yeah. Yeah. But the problem is we mostly want these I guess intuition to hold true in the multi head attention layer. So this is one of the reasons why people

have tried different variations and in particular have these position embeddings intervene directly in the attention layer as opposed to the input because basically when you do it at the input just here fair okay it's going to be roughly something that is going to go

into this attention layer but it's kind of indirect So what we want is to directly kind of do something about the attention formula that would I guess reflect the fact that we want close tokens to be more similar compared to further tokens. And the way we do that is if you

remember the self attention layer is basically the softmax of q krpose over square root of d * v. So what we want is to add a little something inside that softmax which is basically where you quantify how similar a token is to another token.

You want to add a little something to reflect the fact that some tokens they're supposed to be more similar compared to that token compared to other others. So there's a a few methods that have tried to kind of have some variation of that.

So for those of us who know like paper T T5 the T5 paper which we're going to see a little bit later um they have tried these kind of relative position bias by learning the bias term which is in the formula above. So what they did was

let's suppose you have a given distance between the positions m and n. So their idea was let's learn that let's basically bucketize all you know m minus n into some buckets and let's just have the model learn these quantities that are then going to be injected in the softmax.

Yeah. M so question is does that pose a problem that the the bias is here with respect to the probability at the end because it has to sum to one. Well you can do whatever you want inside the softmax because the softmax is going to normalize it anyways.

So you can think of the bias as being something that is maybe more negative for things that are far apart compared to things that are closer together. So T5 says let's learn them. We have another method from um guess this train short Teslong paper which introduced this method called

alibi. Alibi stands for attention with linear bias I believe. And what they did was say instead of learning those biases, let's actually have a deterministic formula which is as a function of the difference the relative difference between those two positions

and they said that so they kind of had some results. So you know all these papers they always kind of compare based on one another to kind of see which one is um is I guess more performant. But the reality is is that in today's models most models actually use another

kind of position embedding methods and we're going to see it now. So this method relies on rotating the query and the key vector by some angle and I guess can think of it as you know you have your query you have your key let's suppose in the 2D space so what

you're going to do is rotate your query by some angle that is a function of its position and you're going to rotate the key vector by some angle that is a function of its position n and

I guess how do you do that by the way I wasn't supposed to show this thing so let's suppose you have a vector by the way and you want to rotate that vector because I had the answer on the slide but guess how would you go about this guess for people who just want to kind

talk about this with intuition. So, who here has done uh I don't know rotations in uh in space? Yeah. Mhm. Yeah, that's correct. Yeah. M matrix multiplication. And you're going to use a quantity that's called rotation matrix.

And uh the rotation matrix is expressed as follows. So it's basically a 2x2 matrix in the 2D plane that has co cosine of this angle minus sign of this angle s of this angle cosine of this angle. I'm looking at the time. There's actually it's quite simple to just show that it works. Uh but we may run out of

time. Do you want you want me to quickly show you that it's indeed a way to uh rotate a vector? Okay. So here as a reminder what we're trying to show is that we can use a matrix multiplication to rotate a vector in 2D space.

So let's suppose we have the following vector that is something that you can um you can quantify with uh two dimensions let's say x and y you can express your vector in 2D space with this right but I guess this if you note are

the norm of the vector and phi the angle respect to the x-axis. You can also write v as r with vector cos of cosine of phi and sine of

phi, right? So if you multiply the rotation matrix with this V, what you're going to obtain is some multiplication of cosine minus s and co cosine of this and that. And I will leave this exercise for you.

But you can show that uh rotation times this v can be expressed as r of cosine of theta + v and sine of theta + v. So this is a quick proof. So I'll just kind of leave you the multiplication of

the rotation matrix and V but you will obtain these like trigonometric identities that will have I guess lead you to this formula. This basically shows that if you multiply this matrix and this vector you're basically rotating the vector by this angle. Yeah. So question is why do you want to do

this? It's a great question. It's my next uh slide. So this is just like a little intro. Um so I guess here just going back to this methods. What we want to do is to quantify the similarity between tokens and have closed tokens be more similar compared to tokens that are more a far.

So the problem that we had with the previous methods was so in the first method this learned embedding you always had this overfitting issue because basically when you learn these biases it always depends on which training set you have.

So maybe your data set in is in a way that let's say tokens that are close are kind of similar but in a different way compared to what you see at inference time and this alibi methods it didn't have that learnable component but this was quite restrictive because

it's a very simple formula after after all right just the relative difference between n and m so I guess people have tried different ways of coming up with something that kind of tells you that I guess an embedding that reflects the fact that you want further positions to be less similar than closer ones. So in

this method, we're going back to the s and cosine world from what the author had proposed and think about similarity from the lens of I guess cosine and s functions. So this is a little intro and their method is called ROP. I'm not sure if you've heard of it. So it stands

for rotary position embeddings and we're going to see that this method. So why why do we care about this method? So this method has two great things. So the first one is that if you rotate the query and the key, you will end up with a quantity that

will be a function of the relative distance between the two. That's going to be very nice. And that's why I I wrote this thing on the blackboard. Not sure if you can see by the way, but um we won't have time to go into the mathematical detail. But if you want to just you know express these things at

home uh this is just a foundation. And so in particular if you remember your attention formula so you have you know query times key transpose. So if you rotate the query by an angle m and the key by an angle n, what you're going to end up is a formula

that has the rotation matrix of angle theta and I guess n minus m. And this is great because this is a function of the relative distance between these two positions. Okay, so why do I talk about this in detail? Well, it turns out that most models these days, they use rope, which

is why it's important. And I would say another thing, it's it's maybe a little bit hard to get the intuition as to why that works, but hopefully the explanation that I gave regarding the, you know, s and cosine at the very beginning can help you just build that intuition.

And speaking of that, it turns out that the upper bound of the attention weight given by the query and the key is such that we observe a long-term decay. Meaning that as m minus m is large, we do see the upper bound that gets kind of smaller and smaller.

Well, you see these little oscillations. It's not like perfect either, but we do have some mathematical uh I guess results as to just the upper bounds kind of decaying over the long term. Cool. Any questions on this? Yeah.

Yep. >> Exactly. Yeah. So the question is the relative distance is captured in the rotation matrix and yes. Yes. Oh yeah. Ah it's a great question. So question is what is theta? So theta is actually

fixed. So do you remember this omega that I talked about here here? So it's basically some function of i and d. I actually kind of uh passed it quite quickly. But what I showed you is in the 2D space but here we're in this dimensional space which is greater than

two. So I kind of glossed it very quickly but the way you extend this method is by having this 2D 2D space kind of by block. But then the theta is a function of uh typically something that you fix but a function of I which is the dimension you know um it's basically between one and d /2

it's a function of that and it's a function of uh d as well. So it's typically you you will see this theta as being roughly equal to omega I which is this this one more or less more or less sorry. Oh so the question is uh so that it has the same dimension as the latent

dimension. So well here you have a product of matrices. So you need to have like the dimensions match. So I guess your answer Yeah. Does that make sense? I'll take that as a yes. Okay. So I I spent a bunch of time on this because uh I think this is actually quite

important. Uh a lot of models use this and uh yeah, I guess the intuition is not super obvious. So I hope this was helpful. Okay. So this was position embeddings. Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. So the question is about how do

you obtain this curve? So this is actually a curve that I believe is shown mathematically cuz basically so it's kind of complicated. We're not going to write down the formula but if you're interested so in this paper in the row farmer paper there's an appendix where

they show mathematically that is upper bounded by some quantity and this is what this is what this is showing. Yep. Great question. Cool. So position embeddings is one part of the transformer that has changed a little bit and we've seen how that changed and why.

So now we're going to see another component of the transformer that has also little bit changed and that component is the layer normalization. So if you remember the transformer architecture is composed again of encoder decoder and

then you have the components inside. So you have these boxes that say add and norm. So what do they mean? So basically here what we do is we take the input as well as the output of this sub layer. We add them together and then we normalize.

So this is a little trick that the authors do and it is shown in practice to improve convergence and just make the convergence be quicker. So the idea is as follows. If you have a vector, sometimes the components of the vector can be super large, sometimes they can

be super small. The idea here is to kind of normalize the components of your vector within some range, some normalized range. So the way you're going to do that is you're going to take your vector and then sub subtract it by the mean

computed mean which is basically the sum of its components and normalize it by basically its uh standard deviation. And what you're going to do is you're going to learn two quantities. One gamma which is going to be the rescaling factor

and then beta which is um another factor another term as well that you learn. And you're going to let these two quantities be learned by your model. And so in practice as I mentioned so what this does is it helps with training stability and with convergence time. So this was a technique that was used in

the original transformer paper. Uh I just want to call out that there has been some changes since then. Um, so we went from normalizing the input plus the output of the sub layer to having a sum of the input and the sub layer of the normalized input.

So in other words, what we've done is to change where the normalization is located. So here in the the transformer paper it was what we now call a postnorm version and nowadays we use a prenorm version which basically consists of having the layer norm right before the vector goes

into the sub layer and sub layer here can be either the attention layer or the ffn but not only that there is also another change. So nowadays people they do not use layer norm. They use something else called RMS norm RMS root mean square normalization which is basically a

variation of what you've seen before. So instead of computing this basically what people do is they just normalize X by the root mean square of the of the components of X and they learn gamma only gamma though. So why do they do that?

Basically they show that the convergence uh properties they're basically comparable but here you have fewer parameters to learn. So it's basically quicker. Yeah. Mhm. Good question. So I guess the question

is what is the intuition behind normalizing? So the intuition is that if you look at your model you have several layers in some layers your model your vector your activation to be more precise. So do you know the the vector that you see that goes from here to here is basically called the activation.

Sometimes the activation has extreme values in one part of its components, sometimes in another part. And the model is typically having trouble in learning the weights in each of these layers if these activations they vary too much. So the idea is to bring the values of

the components of the activation to some range that is not too you know far off in some direction. So in case you're interested there is this key word internal coariate shift which is basically the term that is given to the phenomenon that I'm

describing here. So yeah that's the intuition. Yeah. Oh great great question. So question is what is the difference between this and batch normalization? So batch normalization is normalization across the other

dimension which is the norm the dimension of the batch. So let's suppose you have a bunch of vectors. What you do is you normalize each component with respect to all the other components for the same dimension but of the other vectors.

So you can think of it as just another way of normalizing. Uh but that being said uh when it comes to these like transformer-based models typically people use layer norm probably because empirically it works better but also because uh batch norm you you're basically also dependent on the batch

and it can be it can introduce some I guess differences between training and then inference. So that's basically the reason why. Cool. Great. So we've seen position embeddings, we've seen layer normalization. So now we're going to see

a third important component of the transformer, which is the attention. And in particular, I guess there's something I've not really emphasized, but when you do self attention, you're basically letting every token interact with all other tokens. So when you look at, let's say, a matrix

that shows all the interactions. So you have like n the sequence length and n the sequence length. You basically have of n squ complexity, which is a lot. especially as n goes longer. So people have tried to kind of approximate this you know O of N squ into something that

is a little bit more tractable but does not lose the performance. So there's this paper in 2020 that came out long former. So what it did was just try different versions of the attention by restricting the window at which it operates. So here, instead of letting

each token interact with everyone, each token only interacts with its neighborhoods. Yep. Again, a great question. So question is, do you do that after the uh attention matrix computation? You mean the softmax, right? softmax of so you rais a

great point which is if you do the softmax of everything why why would you do this so in practice there is a bunch of implementations that does a clever so it's called like tiling bunch of clever operations that do not involve this huge matrix operation that you see in the softmax

uh I guess it's like I guess softmax of q krpose over there. You're not going to compute the whole thing. We're going to have a little bit like some cleverness in how you compute that. Basically, yes. So, the question is, can it be um uh something that's compared comparable to convolutions? And we're going to see

that in a second. But yeah, you have some uh I guess similarities with the vision world and we're going to see that in a second. Cool. So nowadays when you have local attention like this, like this people use the term sliding window

attention. So when they use that term they mean this which is basically just restricting the attention to neighboring uh tokens and nowadays what people do is in some layers they will have local attention in some others they will have global attention

and they interle these layers. So depending on the model they you know typically try different combinations. So there's not like a set uh recipe, but it's typically something that is used nowadays. So the window here, I mean for illustrative purposes, uh the window is super small in my illustration, but um I

guess nowadays with the sequence lengths that can be very big, you can think of this window as being of several thousands. So So it seems pretty sizable. And uh just to give you another example. So back to the convolution um um like comparison that you mentioned. So um you

have some architectures and here I'm going to take the example of mistral that has this sliding window attention at every layer. But then uh when you think about it, the token here can attend up to the token here, but then the token here can attend up to the token here, etc., etc.

So, I guess if you think about it, it's kind of similar to the idea of the receptive field in computer vision. So, I'm not sure if you're familiar or kind of from the comput computer vision world, but if you are, um, what this means is just taking one token and trying to

think what other tokens has this token effectively interacted with, which is basically the question that people also sometimes ask when they do convolution. they're like okay so this value what other values did it actually see so yeah you can also think it uh this

way okay so first variation is instead of doing the full you know n byn attention people sometimes do local attention the second variation that is kind of orthogonal to all of this is to not have one projection matrix per head but to share projection matrices across

heads. So here the idea is you have let's say h heads. The idea is you're going to have some number of projection matrices for the query, but then what you're going to do is to group the projection matrices for the key and the value that you're going to share across several heads.

Now, you may ask, why do you share projection matrices for the keys and the values but not for the queries? Is this a question that you you're wondering? Well, here I guess you know people do things to just try out if something works or not.

I guess here you can intuitively think that uh you know the query is basically wondering if something is similar to another thing. So I guess you can ask yourself this question in different ways. So it may make sense to kind of keep that diversity. But one of the core reasons why we choose to group

projection matrices for the keys and the values and not the query is because when you decode you perform a tension between the current word and all the words before. So in other words, every time you generate a new word, you're going to attend that word to all the words

before. So the keys and the values, they're going to come up a lot, right? So every time you want to decode something, you need to kind of attend to all other things again and again. So we're going to see in I think next lecture that there's something called the KV cache

which basically saves the values of the keys and values and one thing that we want is for that cache to not become too big. So if you share projection matrices across heads just allows you to save a little bit of space, a little bit of memory.

That's that's the why. Does that does that roughly make sense? Okay, cool. So speaking of that, there are some variations as to I guess uh just how many projection matrices to uh share. So you have the extreme example where all H heads they all share the same projection matrices for V and and K

and in that case this method is called MQA multi-query attention you have the you know in between case where you share G where G is the number of groups G projection matrices for V and K and then you have groups of size uh let's say H over G.

So this one is called group query attention GQA. And then you have the case that you are very familiar with from the transformer which is every head has its own um query projection, key projection and value projection matrices. And this is the standard multi

heads attention. Cool. So, I'm going to just take uh like a pause to see if uh what I mentioned makes sense. Wanted to soon uh transition it to Shervin. But before I do, I just want to make sure that the way I discussed is kind of making sense roughly. Yeah.

Mhm. So the question is do we apply this to self attention and cross attention? I don't want to spoil uh the show. So I'm going to talk about something later on. But um where is my trans? So if you take a look at the transformer architecture,

we're going to see soon that what we care about most is what is in the decoder because we actually forgo of the encoder in nowadays models. We we have not seen this yet, but I'm just telling you and so this typically comes into play for the masked self attention in the decor.

But this technique can be applied in all attention layers. But I guess what I'm telling you is modern LLMs, they're decoder only models which basically only have the decoder part of the transformer. We're going to see this in a second, which is the masked self attention. So

I'm not going to say too much because Shervin is going to cover that, but yeah, just a quick peak of of what we're going to see. Cool. Yeah. >> Yeah. >> Great question. So question is when do you know which one you should use? I

would say the choice is always driven by a few factors. One is how well it performs. Second is how how much do you care about things like latency costs? Um and so it really depends how big is your model, how much you want to save on let's say compute uh like you know how is your uh input length like for

instance if you have like a shorter input length. So here what we want to do is to avoid having to do all these things for the whole you know O of N squ uh thing. So I guess all of these come into play. So I would say it's not straightforward as to what the answer should be. But I would say a lot of

recent models they tend to share to share projection matrices. So typically I would say GQA is what you would see but um it's not necessarily the case for all models. Cool. We're running out of time so I'm going to have Shervin here for the second part. Thank you.

Okay. Great. Thank you. So we're going to continue uh this lecture with uh some deeper dive into the kinds of models that we have in the transformer landscape. Um and then we're going to do a deep dive into one specific architecture that is very useful for classification settings.

So so first we're going to come back to the architecture that we saw together last time. So this traditional encoder decoder architecture where you have both components and so you have the original transformer paper from 2017 that had this

architecture but also later on you see more architectures that built on top of it. So here we talk about the T5 family of models. So T5 is a paper that's like so so it's an abbreviation of like multiple T's. So the first one is transfer and then it's texttoext transformers. So this is where the T5

naming comes from and then it's derived into multiple versions. So the T5 is like the vanilla paper and then it had MT5. M stands for multilingual. uh where um like there was some more work on the data it was trained on as well as uh like the vocabulary that it was computed uh over and then you have a by T5 which

is some sort of tokenizer free method of all of this where you forgo the fact of tokenizing and instead of that you basically operate at the bite level. So like by is like bytes and basically you have a vocabulary size that is much smaller. So instead of having like a o of 30k

you have two to the power of eight. So like a bite is eight bits and then you can represent every character in two bytes. So that's what they do. Um okay great. And then one thing I want to mention regarding the T5 family is that the objective function changes a bit with what the original transformer

did. So the original transformer did next token prediction for the training task but the T5 family what they did is that um they operated on the so-called span corruption task. So basically you would have your sentence as an input to the encoder and instead of putting everything to the

encoder you would leave blanks and this is what we call you know span corruption and then the span corruption could be one or multiple tokens missing. So if I want to give an example so for example my teddy bear is cute and reading. So you could have my teddy bear span

corrupted and then is reading. So that could be one potential um encoder input and then you could have up to n uh I mean n is the parameterization of the number of spans that are corrupted. So you would have like n such tokens here and then the t5 family calls them

sentinel tokens. So if you see sentinel tokens, they represent a span of corrupted tokens. So you have them here in the encoder. And then the decodor's work is to find each of these spans um in series. So you start with a token that denotes the first corrupted spam and then you start the decoding process

until it hits a prediction that predicts the next uh sentinel token up to the N plus1 one where um the kind of tokens that are decoded between two consecutive Sentinel tokens corresponds to the corrupted spans that are recovered. Yeah. So like this parenthesis is basically a shift from the next token

prediction objective function. Yep. >> Yeah. So the question is can you elaborate with the decoding process? So what you said regarding reconstruction is exactly right. So you have sent tokens that denote some missing text. So what you want to decode is that missing text. So the decoder output will be

exactly like each span reconstructed. Yeah. And then if you want to know how training works, you do a teacher forcing um mechanism where you like input everything in the decoder and then try to reconstruct everything at once. So, uh, any other questions?

Great. Um, and then now we're going to talk about another class of transformers where uh, basically you have this encoder decoder structure where you just forget about the decoder and then just deal with the encoder. So you might tell me okay hey you cannot

do um gener generation with this and then I would I would respond to you you know yes that's exactly the points uh so this encoder and has so it has encoder representations that can be used for u like tasks that might be more geared towards classification so um like sentiment extraction uh token

classification like all of these things that used to be done with specific language models they can be done with the encoder part of the transformer and we're going to dive deeper a bit later into three um like key encoder only models. So BERS which is uh like the central one I would

say in this landscape and then two other architectures distill and Roberta that are uh investigating on axis of uh improvement. So it's going to be good to see. So okay great and then uh there is one last class. So as I've just mentioned uh like today's LLMs they remove the

encoder part al together and then when you have no encoder you don't have your encoded embeddings at the ends of your stacked encoders that could be uh be fed to the cross attention. So this module disappears disappears altogether. So each decoder that is stacked just has masked self attention and an FFN uh as

part of it. Sorry. And uh yeah that's basically um you know something that has uh caught up uh since then because when you look at the popularity of each of these models so you used to have this like transformer-l like architecture that was popular towards the beginning where the main

hypothesis was that like the encoder part is very useful for like getting to the like decoded representation but as time went people realized that your computes budget could be best invested in the decoder only. uh and then um you know you had there there has been more investment into the kind of task that is

I would say easiest to scale up and generalize next word prediction as opposed to the task I just mentioned for T5 which might be uh kind of more bespoke so you need to like corrupt things and then you know so it's more complex whereas like next word prediction is I would say like the

simplest thing you can do and it showed uh like it proved to wonders and well aligns with the task of being a a helpful kind of chatbot which is like today's applications mainly and then the decoder only architectures so I'm not going to talk about them today uh but it's going to be the

central part of the next lectures uh when we're going to talk about LLMs more and more okay awesome So now we can dive deep into you know as promised into encoder only architectures and with birds. So first we're going to start by you know seeing what does BERT mean. So BERT

it's an acronym that denotes birectional uh encoders representations from transformers. and we're going to see together how does each section of this acronym what does it correspond to. So let's just start with uh the encoder part which is like the easiest to to grasp. So as we said we just drop the

decoder. So like this encoder from transformer is basically exactly what it means. Now on the other part so uh so why do we talk about birectionality? So it's a way um so so the paper's result is kind of remark remarkable because we are able from a given input

to get um like output representations that have attended to everything you know for each token. And um this is the case because since we only have the encoder, we have this self attention layer that truly attends to every other token. And this is in contrast with the masked

self attention that you have where we said that the mask is making the attention mechanism causal. So every token can attend to itself and to the tokens before it. And this is by the way something that the authors like discuss a lot in the paper saying that you know GPT came out GPT they're

not truly birectional and then these encodings that can be used for classification task they truly are. Any questions? Yep. Yep, that's right. So, uh the question is when you don't have the mask, each token can attend to each other. You

know, that's exactly right. And then the mask is exactly there to prevent links from tokens to like those that that kind of come after them. Yeah. Okay. Great. So I just want to put this paper in context and you know the field of NLP was booming back then. So you had

another landmark paper that same year which was called Elmo. So embeddings from language models and I would say that the timing of that uh paper was a bit unfortunate because it truly had new insights of also building birectional representations but it just turns out that it came the same year as a

transformer like as as a kind of transformer-based like same line of work. So it got a bit masked by it. So, Elmo just to give the main lines, it was based on a birectional LSTM where you had multiple layers um you stacked on top of each other and basically you were able to build a

birectional representation for each word thanks to this um architecture. And so why didn't it uh get you know why didn't it become as popular as BERT? It's because you had the same downsides as the previous models where basically it's hard to scale uh because of this recurrence.

Um and um you know I think a lot of you you know when you think about Elmo and Bert you don't think about these papers you know at first because they are part of like their characters in Sesame Street and you know I grew up in a place where I I did not know about Sesame Street. So like for me Elma and Berts is

like a paper names but you know it might be you know what represents to you um you know at first so I thought that was quite funny and then you know researchers they're generally quite um you know playful they have u like they try to fit their acronyms into like themes. So if you look at paper names

you you'll get um entertained. Okay great. So to dive deeper into what I mentioned to be the goal of encoder only models. So you have your set of tokens as input and the goal here is to perform tasks that might be uh focused on projecting some representation somewhere. So

typically classification tasks and here the uh like the way BERT works is very specific. So you have two kinds of tokens that you will see uh are kind of structural here. So you have first this CLS token which is which stands for classification and it's basically a placeholder token

that is put at the beginning of the sequence that will then uh at the end of the whole attention and then projection and you know the whole encoder mechanism be projected into an embedding that we can then uh use for classification. So yeah, CLS is just some kind of placeholder that will uh carry the

birectional information of your whole input. And another uh token that might be you know useful to see is this SEP token. So it's like separator. Um and then you will see uh very soon we're we're going to see the objective functions that it operates on. It's uh it aims at

separating uh two sentences. Uh yeah. So this is the very high level and then um so one thing that is very interesting to see with this model is that you you have this concept of multi-stage training. So you don't train the model you know in one shot. You do it in

multiple stages. So the first stage is aimed at being aligned with the task of interest. And uh so this is what we call pre-training and this pre-training we will see in detail is done with two objective functions that are respectively MLM and NSP. So MLM stands for masked lang

language model and NSP is the next sentence prediction. So masked language model it's a way for the model to learn the internal structure of the uh of the inputs and then NSP it might be um seen as a way to see like if the ordering of sentences make sense. So we're going like to go

like a bit deeper into each but it's a combination of objective function that the authors um you know assume to be helpful for learning like general uh general embeddings of high quality. Okay. So the second thing that I want to mention is that once you have all of

this you have a further stage where you keep the embeddings that you have learned and then you attach to it some other network like typically a linear projection to then fine-tune uh what's like the embeddings that you have learned into some target task. So this is what we call fine-tuning.

Yep. So yes, so so the question is um do we still have just an encoder here? Because a next sentence prediction is, you know, could be seen as a decoder task. So it's actually I'm going to go in detail. The next sentence prediction task is actually us putting two sentences one

after the other and predicting whether they're truly consecutive. Uh yeah, so it's a classification task. Yeah, great points and yeah, we're going to see that in detail very soon. So before we see that in detail, um I'm going to discuss the pros and cons uh that this method usually has. So um

so regarding uh like on the pros side, like this pre-training um mechanism can be done on like fairly unlabelled data. So you still have this like next sentence prediction task, but this is something that you control because you know which sentences follow each other. So it's something that you kind of you

know you know you know it's kind of self-s supervised and the masked language model task. We're going to see how it um you know how it consists but um but it's also something that is unsupervised. So this is a very interesting way to learn interesting embeddings out of unlabeled

data. And then uh in practice is that we see that this unlabeled data leads to helpful representations being learned and then you need very little data to build on top of it. So at the finetuning stage you just start from these very nice embeddings that you have learned and you just have a few weights to tune

and then this usually leads to um performance that exceeds state-of-the-art back then and um and then regarding uh you know downsides we have uh you know of course all the text generation uh kind of tasks that are out of reach because we don't have a decoder and also we can see this

two-stage process and the fact that we need to further tune embeddings as something that that can be you know over hurdles. So it might be uh you know when you compare this kind of methodology with respect to more traditional methods that can be you know one shot this could be seen as a downside.

Okay, great. And uh you know I have some uh you know names regarding uh variants here. We're going to dive deep into two of them a bit later on. Okay. So I want us to focus on the original transformer and we're going to go step by step into what happened to it and then how we get the BERT

architecture. So this is what we had in the original transformer paper that we saw last week. And what BERT did is extract the encoder part of it and attach basically this new um objective functions that I just mentioned alongside some new set of tricks uh when it comes to representing

uh tokens. So I think we're going to go uh you know we're going to go through them one by one. So first of all one uh interesting note is that it uses a specific tokenizer called word piece. So you can see it as a tokenizer that learns on your training set based on uh

you know merge rules that maximize the likelihood. So basically you have some huge training set and you train a tokenizer that merges atomic tokens together to build uh your target vocabulary and there's some order of magnitudes I mentioned of 30k so it's typically you

know uh I think this is the size that they chose in this paper and in general um like vocabulary sizes in this sort of paper are in the order of magnitude of 10 to the^ of four 10 to the^ of Except for our token free method that we saw like by T5 which is like this very restricted set of tokens like two to the

power of eight which is like 256 you know apart from this specific case you you always have um kind of this order of magnitude and uh okay and basically we are going to make use of the tokens that I mentioned um like at the beginning. So you have

the saleless token that is going to carry the birectional representation of all your uh sequence and then you have SIP tokens to separate the two sentences towards the next sentence prediction task and there is something that I haven't talked about just yet. Uh so I think

maybe we can talk about it at the time of the deep dive. So basically in order so in order to have this like masked language model task so of course you need to mask some token. So we're going to see the technique that is uh basically applying the sort of mask and where and at each fre at which frequency

and we're going to see with respect to the output what is going to be our task based on the resulting representation. So I'm just going to like pass quickly on it here, but we're going to come back very soon. Okay, great. Um, so one big piece of news regarding your input embeddings. So

like what stays the same. So you still have this huge dictionary lookup of embeddings for each token that you're going to learn and you're going to additively add the positional encoding that we saw at last lecture um and Afin talked about earlier in this lecture which can either be hardcoded or

learned. Uh I think the authors here just uh use an a hard-coded version here. Uh but I'm not too sure like but it's roughly the same performance usually. But there is something new. There is the introduction of a new kind of encoding called segment encoding that

is going to still be additively added to tokens uh with the exception that we just have two uh two possible encodings there. So you have segment A that represents the first sentence and then segment B that represents the second sentence. And it's supposed to help with the NSP task to

represent you know what could be features that can helpfully represent a sentence that precedes another one. Uh so at least that was the hypothesis emitted by the authors. We're going to see it has been challenged later on but uh you know this is one of the key concepts that was introduced here.

Any questions so far? >> Yep. Yeah. So great point. So the question is what does segment encoding like do at all? So it's basically something that is learned. So you have two indices like two basically embeddings that you can learn. you just additively add them uh

you know segment A for like tokens in in the first part of the sentence and then segment B in the second part and you just learn uh you know you just learn it with gradient descent so you do nothing with it I think there was another question here that's right so the question is uh is

every token in the same sentence going to have the same segment encoding the yes. Yep. Okay. Awesome. So I'm seeing I might need to speed up a tiny bit. Um so yeah the second thing that I want to highlight here is that we take the encoder parts of the transformer and uh

you know nothing new here. It's just like the same. We have self attention followed by uh this like FFN. Uh so this is where you're going to get your birectional uh nature of your encodings. Um and then basically we're assuming that training both MLM and NSP on it is going to help us uh like learn helpful

projection matrices in this encoder that can be suited for any classification task. Okay, great. And then I you know as promised I talked about you know detailing more about like what this MLM task was going to do. So when you uh look at the input you're going to uh

basically have your input sentence and replace at random some tokens. uh so it will be replaced either with the token mask so it's in 80% of the time in 10% of the time the tokens selected for this like MLM uh objective function are not going to be replaced at all so we just say you know it's the same token just

predict the same token and then 10% of the time it's going to be changed to some random other world uh word so at the end of it you have this subset of tokens you're going to perform your MLM task on. And then this is, you know, how it's composed. Uh, okay, great. And so basically the

intuition here is that when you want to predict what a token is, you need to know about its context. So you're going to force the model to learn about what surrounds it left and right. So kind of this is the birectional um, you know, property of this architecture put into action.

Okay, great. And now we're going to talk about like the next sentence prediction task where um basically the process here is to put is to select two sentences from a given corpus and then present them um you know side by side in order 50% of the time and in some random order the other um kind of part of the time.

And the goal is for some classification head on top of the CLS token to determine whether A and B are consecutive. So that's all it does. And yeah, so the assumption is that it also helps uh learn some useful embeddings. Okay, great. And uh here I'm going to

present the notation that is used in the paper. So the paper is something I recommend reading. It's a very nice read. Alongside the attention is all you need. I would say it's like a landmark paper. I think it has like 170k citations. Something really impressive. Um and uh basically what we called N in

the original transformer paper is now called L. H that was called D model is the dimension of our embeddings and A is uh the number of attention heads which was called a little h. So here I'm just showing these new notations for information just to like give you the mapping but of course together with Afin

we're going to stay consistent with the original notations we had. So just like for information and uh one interesting note is that you will see that the bird model uh when you look at some um repository of models such as hugging face so usually it's it's given in several versions uh so you

will see sometimes like cased uncased. Uh so this denotes what kind of pre-processing was done to the data whether you only have lower case um words in there or whether casing matters. So based on your task of interest it might be you know one thing you want to choose from.

Okay, great. And uh you know I give some orders of magnitude from the paper on um you know what values were chosen for uh for for each of these. So if I remember correctly I think the original transformer had like 12 stacked encoders and decoders. Um yeah so I think it's

like some some numbers here were kind of taken from there and um yeah so yeah or order of magnitudes is 100 million parameters. Any questions so far? Okay, great. Um, and then now we're going to talk about the fine-tuning stage where the

goal is to basically take whatever we have learned at pre-training stage and then freeze those weights and instead of training again on the same weights, you have some classification linear layer that is put on top of either the CLS token or on top of tokens

of interest. And you're going to learn about the linear embeddings there. You're going to have some classification task. So you can either you know freeze all these like pre-trained weights and just you know train on these small weights or you can just retrain the whole thing. I think there's like a

multiple classification schemes and some of it will be influenced by your willingness to retrain a lot of the network and how different the classification task is with respect to the original pre-training task. Um okay great and then just to give some examples of what could be fine-tuning

tasks for you know tasks of interest you can have a sentiment extraction where you build a classification layer on top of the CLS token and we give some other um you know example a question answering where basically you are given some inputs and the goal of the model is to detect

beginning and end spans of the response. So it's basically some objective function that is at the token level. Okay, great. So now I propose that we do some deep dive into one specific uh example uh you know our favorite example. Um this teddy bear is so cute. Let's just see how um BERT works in

practice. So basically what you would do in an uncased setting is take the sentence like pre-process it like just put everything lower case then you apply the word piece algorithm on whatever tokenization mechanism that your uh like tokenizer has learned. So

for example here you know apparently it had all these merge rules. So this is kind of the tokens that appear in the vocabulary. And then as I promised, we add the CLS token at the beginning. And then we add the SE token. And you also have these like um you know pads tokens that are

basically um used to fill out the the sequence until the end. cuz when you train, you train by batch and then batches are composed of matrices that have a fixed length. Uh yeah, so let's just have like this deep dive a

bit the same as uh like what we had in the transformer uh deep dive last time. So you have the embeddings that are learned. So it's like some huge uh lookup table uh between the index of each token and a learn representation. So you add to it the position embedding of the token and something that's new

here the segment embedding. So exactly as we said it's an embedding that is added to each token and the same embedding is added to the same tokens. So to all the tokens of the same uh segment A and then some other embedding B is added to all the tokens of the segment B.

Okay, great. So now you have you similarly as a transformer something that is position aware and context aware um so not context aware just yet but uh segment aware here uh okay great and uh basically um it's it goes through this encoder architecture and then at the end of it

for the case of sentiment extraction we do not care about the embeddings that are uh corresponding to each token. that is not the CLS token because what we care about is the output embedding of the CLS token where we plug a linear layer uh that will learn some uh classification task.

So any question here? So, does the fact that we drop all the output embeddings apart from the CS token make sense? Yep. Yep. >> Yes. So the question is uh what does this uh you know FFN is that right? What

does this FFN correspond to? So basically you have a map between the dimension of the output embedding and your task of interest. So it might be classification of um you know you know either either positive or negative. So you have some hidden layer with some with some length. So you have like

typically two matrices to learn the projection from one to that hidden layer and then the hidden layer to the output and then you learn these weights in order to do the classification task based on the embeddings that it has learned here. Yeah, great question. So that was the

question I was waiting for. So the question is why do we throw away all these other uh you know output embeddings so we don't need them need them here. So we are in a classification task. we have put as uh convention to operate on top of some token like the CLS token and then the magic of this

token is that all these self attention mechanisms that are in the encoder has mixed the representation of each of the other tokens in that representation such that the output embeddings they are context aware. So basically it's a it's an embedding that is geared towards classification and this is what we say

you know will be what we plug in to that uh you know linear layer and um so when I say you know we throw out all the other embeddings it's actually something that we do for the case of classification but if we do classification at the token level then each of them may be used so for example

when I said question answering if you want to detect whether um you know like a given token is the beginning of a of an answer uh beginning of end of an answer. You would typically have two FFNs that respectively predict the start and end of the answer and you would apply it on each of these

embeddings. Any other questions? Yep. So the question is what is query key and value for CLS? So it's going to be the same process as all the other tokens. So you learn here a representation for the embedding for the token CLS. It gets projected to uh you know query

it gets projected to key it gets projected to value. it does all its attention computation and at the end you get this embedding that is basically um you know that has intended to all the other ones. So it's like the answer is it's the same as for the other tokens. So yeah, so just treat it as one token,

you know, could be any token and and it's the same. Okay, awesome. So I see we have five more minutes and I'm going to uh you quickly go through the end of it and um you know one thing that was great with birds and it was also you know great with Elmo is that you have embeddings

that are contextual um and here uh you can see that it's very easy to learn any classification task that you want based on this learn embeddings. So this is a flexibility that was greatly appreciated here and it's widely used in the industry. So anything that comes with sentiment

detection or like other classification related tasks, it's very common to use a BERT like model for it nowadays and um I'm going to talk a bit about its limitations now. So um as you see in the original paper I think the context length was of size 512. So it was typically limited in this um kind of

early paper has mentioned of techniques as to how we can further grow this context size without making the complexity go completely you know basically like high. uh and then you have some uh approximation methods where you compute local attention and so on and then the

use of these tricks helps you grow the size of the context while staying within reasonable uh computation requirement bounds and I'm going to talk about two other limitations that we're going to see what other models try to remedy. So there is one where um you know the latency could be seen as high. You have

a still 110 million parameters for a bird base. So it's quite a lot you know is there a way to make this you know smaller and faster and then the second one is basically you have these two objective functions of MLM and NSP. Are those two truly helpful? Is there any way we can simplify the pre-training

process? So we're going to see uh in a second how. Um so first regarding this second limitation that we had this uh basically um this basically uh you know sensitivity to cost. So so who here has heard of distillation?

Okay great few people. So I just want to like flash this quote from uh Hinton uh Vinas and Jeff Dean uh which I think is very uh informative and kind of it's a good mindset to have to see that the distribution that is output by a given model is actually super helpful to know what it has learned. So it's the soft

targets contain almost all the knowledge. So it's like some lecture from from them that contain this these quotes and I feel so so basically they were at the origin of the concept of distillation later on and you quickly see in practice that basically learning the distribution of a model is more

helpful than directly learning the hard labels. So you have this concept of teacher and student models where basically um you know the goal in distillation is going to be to map this output distribution of a smaller model directly to your more complex model rather than the hard

labels. And the um you know the objective function that you use for this to minimize this is the KL divergence which basically says in a world that is described by the teacher the teacher T how bad is it to model with the student S. So it basically kind of tries to

assess how close the student distribution is going to be to the world's t. And um one interesting note that you will see here is that you find the cross entropy loss if your yt distribution is just a hard label. So if you have just a one at one position and then zero everywhere else you have minus

log of you know ys which is very interesting. And then when the distilled bear forks have done so by the way it's a very clean paper it's like four pages but super impactful. So it says that you know if you reduce the number of layers by two you have a lot of gains and

almost the same performance uh which is kind of very remarkable and they basically used distillation as a way to retain that performance. So this has been like the key alongside the the like diminishing the number of layers. And last I'm going to talk about Roberta that uh studied the fact that removing

the NSP um objective function led to no decrease in performance almost. So they just dropped it. And they added some tricks such as um you know dynamically doing the masking. So for example for a given piece of text at each epoch so every time you see the same kind of text you

would change the masking and they also had some data strategy where they saw that the model was vastly undertrained. So they increased the diversity and the size of the data a lot and they saw that uh kind of benchmark performance increased uh quite a bit on the same benchmarks.

And that's it for today. Thank you everyone. Have a great weekend.
